# Feature Engineering and Model Creation

Overview of ML model creation and cleaning.

### 1. Imports:

```python
import pandas as pd
import joblib
import re
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder
```

- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling DataFrames.
- **joblib**: Used for efficient serialization and deserialization of Python objects, like trained models and encoders/scalers.
- **re**: Used for regular expression operations, specifically to extract executable names from log messages.
- **sklearn.preprocessing**: Contains classes for data preprocessing, including StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, and LabelEncoder.

### 2. CleanedDF Class:

#### `__init__(self, file_path, scaler_path="models/scaler.pkl", encoder_path="models/encoder.pkl")`:
Constructor that initializes the class with the file path of the CSV log file and paths to saved scalers and encoders.
It loads the data immediately by calling `self._load_data()`.

#### `_load_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame`:
Loads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handles potential file loading errors using a try-except block.
Extracts executable names from the "Message" column using the `_extract_exe` method and creates a new "Exe" column.

#### `_extract_exe(message: str) -> str`:
A static method that uses regular expressions to extract the first executable name (e.g., "example.exe") from a log message.
Returns the executable name or None if no executable is found.

#### `preprocess(self)`:
The core method for preprocessing the loaded data. It performs several key steps:

- **Datetime Conversion**: Converts the "EventTime" column to datetime objects and creates a "Timestamp" column with Unix timestamps. Extracts "DayOfWeek", "Month", and "Year" features.
- **Numerical and Categorical Handling**: Defines numerical and categorical column lists. Converts numerical columns to numeric, filling missing values with the median. Converts categorical columns to strings, filling missing values with "Unknown".
- **Drop LogonType**: Drops the LogonType column.
- **One-Hot Encoding of "Exe"**:
  - Loads a pre-trained OneHotEncoder or fits a new one if it doesn't exist.
  - Transforms the "Exe" column into one-hot encoded features.
  - Adds a column, "UnseenExe", that flags Exe values that were not seen during training.
  - Stores the original "Exe" column into the "OriginalExe" column, before the Exe column is one hot encoded and then dropped.
- **Label Encoding of Categorical Features**: Label encodes the "AccountName", "AccountType", and "Severity" columns.
- **Normalization of Numerical Features**: Loads a pre-trained StandardScaler or fits a new one. Scales the numerical features.
- **Drop Object Columns**: Drops any remaining columns with object data types.
- Adds the Original Exe column back to the dataframe.

#### `print_info(self)`:
Prints the DataFrame's information (data types, non-null counts) and data types of each column.

### Key Functionality:

- **Data Loading and Extraction**: Loads log data from CSV and extracts executable names.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates time-based features and one-hot encoded features.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and data type conversions.
- **Data Transformation**: Scales numerical features and encodes categorical features.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves and loads scalers and encoders using joblib.
- **Anomaly detection preparation**: The class prepares the data for an anomaly detection model.

### 2. IsolationForestModel Class:

#### `__init__(self, model_path="isolation_forest.pkl", contamination=0.1)`:
Constructor that initializes the class with the path to the saved Isolation Forest model and a contamination parameter (default is 0.1). The contamination parameter defines the proportion of outliers in the dataset.

#### `train(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`:
Trains the Isolation Forest model on preprocessed data.

- **Drop non-numeric columns**: Removes columns with non-numeric data types, as the model only works with numeric data.
- **Fit the model**: The model is trained using the `fit` method of the IsolationForest class.
- **Save the model**: The trained model is saved to disk using `joblib.dump`.

#### `predict(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`:
Predicts anomalies in new log data.

- **Drop non-numeric columns**: Similar to the training phase, non-numeric columns are removed from the DataFrame.
- **Make predictions**: The model predicts anomalies using the `predict` method of the IsolationForest model. A result of -1 indicates an anomaly, and 1 indicates normal data.
- **Anomaly scores**: The `decision_function` method returns anomaly scores, with lower values indicating more anomalous points.

#### `load_model(self)`:
Loads a pre-trained Isolation Forest model from disk.

- **Load the model**: The trained model is loaded from the specified `model_path` using `joblib.load`.

### Key Functionality:

- **Model Training**: The class trains an Isolation Forest model on numeric data and saves it to disk.
- **Anomaly Detection**: The class predicts anomalies in new log data by using the trained model.
- **Model Persistence**: The class saves and loads trained models using joblib, allowing for model persistence across sessions.
