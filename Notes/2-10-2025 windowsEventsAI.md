# Anomaly Detection with Windows Event Logs

## Overview

Windows Event Logs are essential for monitoring system activity and security. Analyzing these logs can provide insights into system performance and user behavior. In this guide, we will focus on using unsupervised learning for anomaly detection through clustering. This approach helps to identify abnormal patterns of system behavior, which can be indicative of security breaches or other issues.

## 1. Preprocessing the Log Data

Before applying machine learning algorithms, we need to preprocess the raw log data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

### **Steps for Preprocessing:**
1. **Parse the Logs:**
   If your logs are unstructured (e.g., plain text), you'll need to parse them into a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or DataFrame) for easier analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   Transform the raw log entries into meaningful features that can be used for clustering:
   - **Timestamps:** Calculate the time between log entries or extract features like hour of the day, day of the week, etc.
   - **Event Types:** Encode different event types (e.g., login attempts, system errors) into numerical values.
   - **User IDs:** Track which users are involved in which events to monitor user activity.
   - **Action Counts:** Count the actions per user, IP address, or device (e.g., how many failed login attempts in a time window).

## 2. Apply Clustering

Clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning method for anomaly detection. By grouping similar behavior together, it can identify unusual activity that doesn't fit into any cluster. There are several clustering algorithms that can be used for anomaly detection:

### **Clustering Algorithms:**
1. **K-means:**
   - **How it works:** K-means is efficient and simple to implement. However, it requires you to specify the number of clusters beforehand.
   - **Anomaly Detection:** In the context of anomaly detection, observations that don't belong to any cluster (i.e., they are far from the centroids) can be considered anomalies.

2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**
   - **How it works:** DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be specified beforehand and can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. It is particularly useful for detecting anomalies because it labels low-density points as "noise" (outliers).
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Points that do not fit into dense clusters are flagged as anomalies.

3. **Isolation Forest:**
   - **How it works:** While not a clustering algorithm per se, Isolation Forest is designed specifically for anomaly detection. It isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then recursively partitioning the data.
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Anomalous data points are isolated faster, making them easy to detect in large datasets.

## 3. Building the Model

Once the logs are preprocessed and the features are engineered, we can apply a clustering algorithm to the data.

## 4. Evaluating Anomalies

Once the model is built, evaluate how well it detects anomalies:
- **Manual Inspection:** Examine flagged anomalies to ensure they make sense. For example, check if a userâ€™s behavior deviates significantly from expected patterns.
- **Performance Metrics:** If you have labeled anomalies, you can use precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model. These metrics will help determine how well the model detects true anomalies without flagging normal behavior as anomalous.

## 5. Visualizing the Clusters

Visualizing the results can help you understand how the model is grouping logs and detecting anomalies.
